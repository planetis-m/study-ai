Extract and clean this PDF lecture file.

Instructions:
- Work ONLY with provided content—NEVER add external information or examples
- Use proper markdown formatting with headers and structure
- Never include introductory or concluding remarks (no "Here are the notes...", etc.)
- Remove metadata (instructor info, headers, footers, page numbers, timestamps, course codes)
- Preserve educational content (concepts, definitions, examples) that is clearly readable
- If extracted content is fragmented or unclear, skip those sections without attempting to interpret them
