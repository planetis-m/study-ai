Extract and clean this PDF lecture file, preserving all educational content.

After extraction, check for pages with only titles, headings, page numbers, or figure references. Call read_by_ocr for those pages, batching consecutive ranges.
If OCR output is fragmented or unclear, skip those pages without attempting to interpret the content.
