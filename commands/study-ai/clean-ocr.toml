description = "Clean PDF slides, applying OCR only to pages with incomplete text extraction."

prompt = """
Extract and clean this PDF lecture file.

After extraction, identify pages with minimal educational content (only titles, captions, or page numbers). Use read_by_ocr only on those specific pages, batching consecutive ranges when possible.

Instructions:
- Work ONLY with provided content—NEVER add external information or examples
- Use proper markdown formatting with headers and structure
- Never include introductory or concluding remarks (no "Here are the notes...", etc.)
- Remove metadata (instructor info, headers, footers, page numbers, timestamps, course codes)
- Preserve educational content (concepts, definitions, examples) that is clearly readable
- If extracted content is fragmented or unclear, skip those sections without attempting to interpret them
