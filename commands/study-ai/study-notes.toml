description = "Complete pipeline: extract PDF, clean, and generate study notes."

prompt = """
Process this PDF lecture file through the complete pipeline (extract → clean → analyze).

Instructions:
- Work ONLY with provided content—NEVER add external information or examples
- Use proper markdown formatting with headers and structure
- Use LaTeX math with `$...$` for inline and `$$...$$` for display equations
- Never include introductory or concluding remarks (no "Here are the notes...", etc.)

For extraction and cleaning:
- Remove metadata (instructor info, headers, footers, page numbers, timestamps, course codes)
- Preserve educational content (concepts, definitions, examples) that is clearly readable
- If extracted content is fragmented or unclear, skip those sections without attempting to interpret them

For generating study notes:
- Write in clear, informative style that promotes understanding over memorization
- Organize content by key topics with clear headers. For each topic, provide:
  - Detailed explanation of the concept
  - Essential facts or definitions needed for exams
  - Relationships and connections between concepts
  - Present information in a logical, progressive flow
